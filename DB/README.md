# Here is where we create the dockerized Neo4j 3.3.0 with all the information scraped from the Mexican Senate.
First we need to rearrenge the information into different CSV, so we run the create_csv.sh file and then we can create de database.
Everything from the csv extraction to the turning on of the Neo4j image is done by the execution of the execute.sh file.
